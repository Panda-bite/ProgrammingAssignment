The script run_analysis.R achieves the following objectives.

1. Merges the two datasets into one dataset. This data set is called 'testtrain'

2. Along with the creation of this dataset, the activity and subject columns have been named appropriately.

3. It extracts the mean and standard deviation values in a data frame called 'stdandmean'

4. Lastly, creates an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
